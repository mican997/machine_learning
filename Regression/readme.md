this is note and template about linear regression and so on. mainly this template is from udemy courses with a little bit of twist

# Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to measure how closely related independent variable(s) relate with a dependent variable. An extensive use of regression analysis is building models on datasets that accurately predict the values of the dependent variable.

### Correlation 
Correlation is usually defined as a measure of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables (e.g., height and weight). Often a slightly looser definition is used, whereby correlation simply means that there is some type of relationship between two variables. it's highly recommended to do correlation analysis first before doing regression analysis to make sure the model will be good.

## Different forms of Regression Analysis
 ### Linear Regression
Linear Regression works by using an independent variable to predict the values of dependent variable.
In linear regression, a line of best fit is used to obtain an equation from the training dataset which can then be used to predict the values of the testing dataset. The equation can be of the form: y = mx + b 
where y is the predicted value, m is the gradient of the line and b is the point at which the line strikes the y-axis.

 ### Multiple Linear Regression
 
 ### Polynomial Regression
 
 ### Support Vector Regression(SVR)
 
 ### Decision Tree Regression 
 
 ### Random Forest Regression
